 * name because neither operator had opened Settings. A generic default is a
 * collision generator — every deployment that skips the step lands on the same
 * name, and a directory then has to tell them apart by something else.
 *
 * Derived from the deployment's own `site_url` instead, which makes it unique
 * wherever the domain is: `blyg.thoughtfolio.xyz` publishes as
 * `thoughtfolio.xyz`, not as `blyg`. A leading `blyg.` or `www.` is dropped
 * because neither says anything about whose blyg it is.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** a made-up human name. The honest default is the address,
 * which is true on day one and obviously a placeholder to its owner; inventing
 * "Thoughtfolio's Blyg" would be the client asserting something the operator
 * never said. Venkat's session-29 framing: two people may legitimately both
 * call their blyg the same thing, so the fix is not to forbid collisions but to
 * stop manufacturing them.
