// Generated changelog notes — decision #40, spec §5.2 + §16.6c.
//
// The studio drafts a note from the local diff between the published version
// and the working copy; the author sees it in the note field and may edit it
// before publishing. Drafting happens before publish, never inside it: publish
// stays network-free (#26), and a note nobody looked at is not "editable before
// publish".
//
// The one hard rule is depth (§5.2): **a note describes a change; it never
// reproduces withheld content.** Where the prior version is unpinned its text is
// private, so the note describes and MUST NOT quote it. Between two pinned
// versions nothing is withheld and the note may be as full as it likes. The
// prompt says so, and `quotesWithheld` checks it mechanically, because a prompt
// is a request and this is a rule.
