// Snapshot freshness for threads — decision #33's direct check, and the
// detection half of #38 ("detect always, refresh only on a decision, never
// silently").
//
// A thread bakes each quote at the version it held when it published (§10.2).
// That quote is *stale* when a newer version of the same target exists, and
// only the direct relation counts: a quote of B is not stale because B's own
// quote of C moved (§10.4, #45). Two places a newer version can be:
//
//   - **here** — our own item has been republished, or the importer has already
//     pulled the source's new version. A republish re-bakes it now.
//   - **only at the origin** — the source has republished and our import has
//     not caught up. Fetching `{origin}items/{id}.json` and comparing `version`
//     is the whole check (§5.9); a refresh resyncs that subscription first.
//
// "What a republish would bake" is answered by `resolveTarget` itself, not by a
// second lookup written to agree with it, so this report cannot drift from
// what publish actually does.
