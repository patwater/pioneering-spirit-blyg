# Blygger Studio — Project Instructions

> **Environment rules, keys & safety policies:** see [`Code/CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md), `warnings.md`, `warnings-node.md`, `warnings-keys.md`, `security-policy.md` at the `Code/` level. Read before starting work.
> **The protocol lives elsewhere:** [`../blygger-spec/`](../blygger-spec/). This repo is **one implementation**, not where protocol decisions get made.

Blygger Studio is the reference client for the Blygger protocol — a Cloudflare Worker
that publishes a blyg, subscribes to others, and threads, transcludes and responds
across them. Public repo: `blygger/blygger-studio` (branch `main`).

Split out of `blygger-spec/worker/` at session 26 (2026-09-28) with all 59 commits of
history, when six independent client implementations made a combined spec+implementation
repo untenable. Named `blyg-ref` until then; `CLIENT` in `src/types.ts` is the one place
the name and version live.

## Where the process lives

**This repo has no session ritual and no devlog of its own.** Both stay in
`blygger-spec`, which remains the program's log across all four repos:

| Thing | Where |
|---|---|
| Session-start ritual, session numbering, carry-overs | [`../blygger-spec/CLAUDE.md`](../blygger-spec/CLAUDE.md) |
| `DEVLOG.md` — one log for the whole program | [`../blygger-spec/DEVLOG.md`](../blygger-spec/DEVLOG.md) |
| Locked protocol decisions (#1–#29) | `../blygger-spec/CLAUDE.md` |
| Model routing (⚠️ FABLE gates) | `../blygger-spec/CLAUDE.md` |
| Four-track program roadmap | [`../blygger-spec/docs/roadmap-tracks.md`](../blygger-spec/docs/roadmap-tracks.md) — this repo is **Track 2** |
| Plan docs (`v0.3-plan.md` etc.) | `../blygger-spec/docs/` |

**Model routing applies here too.** This repo implements semantics; it does not set
them. If a task touches protocol semantics, cross-client invariants, security/crypto or
API-surface design, it is ⚠️ FABLE — stop and say so rather than improvising. Two live
examples, both **ruled session 27 (2026-09-28)**: the `/api` write contract (roadmap-tracks
1.8 → decision #31: the client's own contract, never the protocol's; auth direction fixed)
and whether a citation's human half goes on the wire (1.2 → decision #30: yes, `cited`).
The rulings and their build consequences are in `../blygger-spec/docs/v0.3-plan.md` §8c.

## Stack conventions

- Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2, TypeScript, wrangler. Node: `/usr/local/bin/node` (see `warnings-node.md`; **no `node_modules/` synced by Dropbox** — follow the policy there).
- **`npm install` needs `--legacy-peer-deps`.** npm 10.9.0's peer resolver crashes on vitest's optional peer graph; the environment, not this repo. A fresh clone hits it, an incremental install does not.
- **Studio is a React SPA; public pages stay server-rendered** (0.10.0, session 30 — Venkat
  reversed v0.1-plan's "no client-side framework" rule when merging Kyle Mathews' #21/#22).
  Studio: React + TanStack Router/DB + Base UI under `src/ui/`, built by `npm run build`
  (also `postinstall`/`pretest`/`predeploy*`) and embedded in the Worker. It talks to `/api`
  only through the generated SDK (`sdk/generated/`, from `openapi.json`, from the Zod
  contract in `src/contract/`). Change a route → `npm run sdk:generate`; CI fails on drift.
  Public pages, protocol files, static export and cron are still server-rendered from
  `src/pages.ts`/`src/protocol.ts` with no framework, and that is not changing.
- **Inline page scripts live inside TS template literals, so escapes are a live hazard** —
  now only on the *public* pages (`VERSION_NAV_SCRIPT` and kin in `pages.ts`); the Studio's
  inline scripts were deleted by 0.10.0: write `\\n` (not `\n`) inside a `confirm()`/string in `actionScript`/`composerScript`/`FEED_SCRIPT`, or the emitted JS gets a real newline inside a string literal and the whole script fails to parse. Session 19 shipped a studio where every button was dead this way, **with the full suite green** — assertions about HTML pass whether or not the `<script>` in it is valid JavaScript. `test/inline-scripts.test.ts` compiles every inline script via `new Function`; keep new pages covered by it.
- **Page scripts need behaviour tests, not just markup tests.** For the Studio that now means
  the Playwright suite (`npm run test:e2e`, desktop + mobile Chromium, 118 tests at 0.10.0) and
  `npm run test:ui`; the Worker suite keeps API, public-output and lifecycle tests. The same blind spot produced a second session-19 bug: the shared action handler ends in `location.reload()`, correct for every action that leaves the item in place and wrong for `discard`, which deletes it (reloading an editor URL 404s). Assert on what a handler *does* — where it navigates, what it calls — not only that the button rendered.
- Secrets: wrangler secrets only; register every key in `Code/.env.keys` per `warnings-keys.md`. Never commit secrets.

## Identity and versioning

`CLIENT` in `src/types.ts` is the single source of truth for this client's name and
version, and `GENERATOR` derives from it. Both user-agent strings
(`IMPORTER_USER_AGENT`, `MENTION_USER_AGENT`) derive from `GENERATOR` — before session
26 they were hand-written and had drifted to `blyg-ref/0.2` and `blyg-ref/0.3` on a
0.3.0 client.

**Client version ≠ protocol version, always.** `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is what the wire
carries and is governed by decision #18d; `CLIENT.version` is this software's identity
and the wire is indifferent to it. Do not couple them, and do not derive `CLIENT.name`
from `BRAND` — `BRAND` is the protocol's vocabulary, which this client does not own.

Bumping `CLIENT.version` is what blygger.com's directory census reads to decide a node
is behind (roadmap-tracks Track 3.1), so a release that changes behaviour operators
should adopt must bump it.

## Deployment

`npm run deploy:all` drives every deployment in `deploy-targets.json`, each against its
own pinned Cloudflare account, with a tsc+test gate, migration preflight and post-deploy
live verification. Protocol and rationale: `../blygger-spec/docs/deploy-protocol.md`
(built session 17 after incident `2026-09-12-01`, a wrong-account deploy).

**Our deploy config is not committed (session 28).** The client ships as a generic
artifact anyone can stand up, so committed `wrangler.jsonc` names no account, database,
route or domain, and `deploy-targets.json` is gitignored. Ours live in
`wrangler.private.jsonc` and `deploy-targets.json`, both gitignored, both at the repo
root — wrangler resolves `main` and `migrations_dir` relative to the config file, so
neither can move into a subdirectory. `deploy-all.ts` prefers the private config when it
exists and falls back to the committed one when it does not, which is also what makes a
self-hoster's own `wrangler.jsonc` work with no flag.

Per-target spellings (`deploy:all` is blocked in auto mode):

```bash
npm run deploy:vgr    # wrangler deploy --config wrangler.private.jsonc --env venkateshrao
npm run deploy:pi     # wrangler deploy --config wrangler.private.jsonc --env protocolInstitute
```

**If you lose the private files:** every value in them is readable from the Cloudflare
dashboard, but rebuilding by hand is how incident `2026-09-12-01` happened. `test/
deploy-manifest.test.ts` cross-checks them on every `npm test` — and note *how* it
detects their presence: `import.meta.glob`, not `node:fs`. Inside the Workers test pool
the filesystem is sandboxed, so `existsSync` returns false for a file that is plainly
there, and a `runIf` on it would skip the live half silently while the suite went green.

**Authenticate with `wrangler login`, not `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`.** Both registry tokens
are single-account and the personal one has no D1 scope, so the migration preflight
cannot run from either; an env token silently overrides the OAuth session, so **unset it**
before deploying. One OAuth session reaches both accounts.

## `/api` is a documented contract with owner and delegated access (OAuth/MCP merged 0.28.0, session 36)

**Since 0.10.0** (#21, Kyle Mathews): 39 operations defined once in `src/contract/` (Zod →
OpenAPI 3.1 → `openapi.json`, served to the owner at `/api/openapi.json`), resource-shaped
(POST creates, PATCH edits, PUT pins), documented in `docs/api.md`, consumed through the
generated SDK. The pre-0.10 routes (`PUT /items/:id`, `/fork`, `/stubs`, `/items/:id/pin`,
`PUT …/responses`, pause/resume, …) were removed with **no aliases** — Venkat accepted the
break (session 30). Kyle's phase 3 (`docs/migration.md` §3: ecosystem clients, then OAuth and
MCP) **was ruled session 31 (2026-10-03, decision #52): it proceeds, and Kyle builds 2.9.**
OAuth is a way of *minting* #31's tokens (IndieAuth is what Micropub itself uses), and MCP is
a transport for the contract, not a second one. **Review his auth PR against these four
invariants before merging; Opus reviews and does not build tokens:**

1. **One token model.** OAuth mints #31's tokens — scoped, listed, per-token revoke and
   revoke-all in the studio; the password is typed only on the studio's own login page. A
   manual mint-and-paste path exists beside the flow (CLI tools, crons and the reference
   agent have no browser).
2. **No `.well-known`, no manifest key.** `/.well-known/` is host-rooted and breaks a
   path-mounted blyg (`venkateshrao.com/blyg/` is one); discovery is the HTML `rel` link on
   the studio page and the metadata lives under the mount. Nothing reaches `blyg.json`.
3. **Scopes:** a read scope for studio-private material; publishing a distinct verb from
   drafting; no refresh-only scope (#38). Names are his; studio#11 lists the measured demand.
4. **MCP:** same operations, same scopes, a token like any tool. Text written through it is
   disclosed via client-recorded provenance (`tk-provenance`, studio#11) with `sources` in
   the spec's §5.9 reference shape. Polling, not webhooks.

Password reset rides with his auth middleware (#31: after tokens, MUST offer revoke-all).
Upstreaming Blygger Desktop's reading-rows and read-state extensions is fine — studio-private.
Reasoning: `../blygger-spec/docs/v0.4-plan.md` §8.1.

The owner still signs in with the existing password and 30-day owner cookie.
Delegated clients use scoped OAuth grants or named manual bearer tokens. Studio
lists grants and supports individual revocation and revoke-all. REST and MCP
share the same permission rules. See `docs/client-access.md` for the current
contract and `docs/auth-security-oracles.md` for its security checks.

**Third-party authoring tools are already writing to it** — a native macOS studio, a
Drafts action, an Obsidian plugin. Making this a real contract (tokens, scopes,
versioning, idempotency) **was** ⚠️ FABLE-gated on two counts and is now **unblocked**
(decision #31, session 27): it is this client's contract, not the protocol's. Direction
is fixed — per-client bearer tokens with coarse verb scopes, owner-minted and revoked in
the studio, the owner password as root credential that no tool ever holds, revoke-all,
CORS for token-bearing requests, endpoint discovery via an HTML `rel` link on the studio
page (never a manifest key). Build within that direction; anything beyond it is still
Fable. Do not harden it in a way that breaks the tools now depending on it without
saying so.

## Status

**0.32.2** (session 38, 2026-10-06): security fix for mention verification (#61): the item document must come from exactly `{origin}items/{id}.json`, so same-host path-mounted impostors and pinned stub files fail, and a target outside the mount is refused. TK sources come from the instruction only, and publish warns on an unrequested own-line directive in TK output (#60). `page` stability test (#56). No migrations.

**0.32.1** (session 37, 2026-10-06): Kyle Mathews' #40, the D1 polling cache: Studio checks `/api/changes` revision counters (27 triggers, **migration 0024**) before reloading; `feed.xml` is served from R2 with ETags/304s, stale-while-revalidate, warmed by a minute cron. Three crons now (`* * * * *`, `*/15 * * * *`, `0 0 * * *`); a pre-0.32 `*/15`-only config still gets the daily work at 00:00 UTC. **0.32.0 was never released:** its 0024 used `SELECT CASE … END;` trigger guards, which D1's remote executor cuts at the first `END;` (local apply passes); `test/migration-remote-shape.test.ts` now rejects that shape. Before a D1 restore, see `docs/d1-polling-cache-operations.md`.

**0.31.0** (session 37): one response action. *Quote selection* and the reading-view pill are gone; a stub opens quoting the whole post; passages are chosen in the stub editor (`src/ui/stub-quote.ts`), with further passages added after the cursor for a running commentary; a "How stubs work" sheet. No migration.

**0.30.1** (session 37): a `304` poll skipped the daily index sync and name refresh, so ETag-honouring blygs whose first sync failed never synced again; live preview spends the read budget. No migration.

**0.30.0** (session 36, 2026-10-05): subscription names follow their source (**migration 0023**, `subscriptions.title_auto`; manifest title at the daily sync, RSS channel title every poll, owner names protected); resync all feeds (`POST /api/subscriptions/poll`); "Draft discarded" toast; long stubs quote their opening; thread counter without the limit; quote-only compose rows resolved. The first release after 0.28.2: 0.28.3 and 0.29.0 were deployed but their tags failed `release:check` and were deleted.

**0.29.0** (session 36): the `[[`/`![[` picker is a panel with full-text SQL search (`source`, `sub`, `sort`), and the `picker_typing` setting (automatic / editor / picker). No migration.

**0.28.3** (session 36): the outbound DNS check used `redirect: 'error'`, which the Workers runtime rejects, so every poll and Webmention failed on both nodes for ~70 minutes after 0.28 deployed. Now `'manual'`. No migration.

**0.28.0–0.28.2** (session 36): Kyle Mathews' #34 — OAuth grants, manual tokens, MCP, four scopes, the Access page, and a security pass (allowlist sanitizer, SVG sandbox, private draft media, outbound-destination checks, owner/grant work budgets; **migrations 0021, 0022**; needs `nodejs_compat`). 0.28.1 unwraps unlisted tags (0.28.0 deleted their content); 0.28.2 bakes transclusions verbatim again (sanitize at render). **The owner budgets bite in practice:** 120 writes/min throttled live preview (raised in the private config; `fix/preview-budget` moves preview to the read budget) and 20 AI calls/day applied to the owner (interim 200). Follow-ups are on studio#39.

**0.27.2** (session 35, 2026-10-05): the editor's TK generate kept only the scope's output since 0.10.0; the generate route now also returns the spliced `content_md`. No migration.

**0.27.1** (session 35, 2026-10-05): 0.27.0 released. Every Release run since v0.21.2 had failed (an e2e screenshot to a machine-local path; the mutation tree missing `build/models.json`), so 0.21.2–0.27.0 have no downloads. No migration.

**0.27.0** (session 35, 2026-10-05): highlight generated portions on public pages. A `highlight_generated_default` setting and a per-item `highlight` override (**migration 0020**, `items.highlight_override`). The default lives in `style.css` and an override is a `gen-on`/`gen-off` class on the `<article>`. Themes have `genBg`/`genRule`. Robot badge (Brady Dale's convention); `GEN_INFO_SCRIPT` opens a version-level disclosure box from `data-generated`.

**0.26.1** (session 35, 2026-10-05): subscribe backfills under `waitUntil`; duplicate subscriptions 409; a source-URL citation line on every reading card; reading lands on the feed, with Feed/Sources tabs and one `ReadingHead` under every lens; Smart Feed "Coming soon". No migration.

**0.26.0** (session 34, 2026-10-04): one model per AI function (`ai_model_tk`/`_changelog`/`_feed`, falling back to the pre-0.26 `ai_model`, kept one release as a write alias) from an editable **`models.json`** (gitignored `models.local.json` overrides, merged at build into `build/models.json`; releases ship the base list only); OpenAI Responses and Gemini generateContent adapters beside Anthropic, all raw HTTP (`src/ai/provider.ts`, `src/ai/models.ts`); secrets `AI_PROVIDER_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_AI_KEY`; `GET /api/ai/models`; the `feed_prompt` setting (stored, unused until the smart feed's agent). No migration.

**0.25.0** (session 34, 2026-10-04): reading lenses (All/Threads/Fragments filter by kind, `kind` on `/api/reading`; Background and Smart Feed placeholders); the private **interaction log** (**migration 0019**, backfilled; `src/interactions.ts`, logged at the store and at publish, never on the wire); `GET /api/interactions`, `GET /api/thumbs`; more → signals.

**0.24.0** (session 34, 2026-10-04): public hoppers listed as Collections on the homepage and archive; the hopper page gets `pageTop`, metadata and a description (**migration 0018**, `hoppers.description`); its Home link no longer points at the host root on path mounts.

**0.23.0** (session 34, 2026-10-04): stale quotes move from a compose banner to an *updates* tab, stalest first by `behind` (versions missed, summed over stale quotes); the batching norm stated on the page. No migration.

**0.22.0** (2026-10-03, contributed): the studio redesigned for the phone after Thicket Console — wears the reading theme, tab bar, NetNewsWire-style reading, bottom sheets for every confirm, copy + link / share, link from clipboard, scan-text instructions (optional on-device Tesseract), installable PWA. No API, contract or data changes; no migration.

**0.21.2** (session 34, 2026-10-04): five conformance-toolkit fixes (studio#27–#31): any feed gap reconciles; stub version agreement matches origin and id; forks keep a legacy author's `>` lines (partiality from `blyg-partial`); remote fork cites the pinned page when served; `<dc:creator>`. No migration.

**0.21.1** (session 34, 2026-10-04): akashtattva's #33, feeds for strict RSS readers (batched feed queries, ~4 s → ~0.5 s; absolute titled discovery link; atom self-link), with the provenance loader shared between feed and pages. No migration.

**0.21.0** (session 33, 2026-10-03): a *Version N / Change* confirmation dialog before every new version with a note (typed, drafted, or auto-drafted), and the `auto_change_notes` setting (off by default) that drafts one when the field is empty (#40). No migration.

**0.20.2** (session 33, 2026-10-03): XML-invalid characters filtered from the feed and stripped at publish, grapheme-safe excerpts (studio#15 parts 2–3; `src/text.ts`); `npm test` no longer fails on an operator's own `wrangler.jsonc` — the template guard is CI-only `npm run check:template` (studio#1); local migrations reserved `9000_`+ (studio#10).

**0.20.1** (session 33, 2026-10-03): own-line `![[id]]` in TK output is a quote again (provisional — Fable's §9.2 reading over studio#5, pending reconciliation with #20); "TK transcludes are not yet implemented" for imported/thread TK sources (until G8).

**0.20.0** (session 33, 2026-10-03): a fork flattens its pinned document (#57, `src/fork-flatten.ts`): quotes as attributed blockquotes, generated spans as impyrt, whole-HTML fallback. The build side of gate G11. No migration.

**0.19.0** (session 33, 2026-10-03): the composer autosaves (studio#23; first save after a 3 s pause and ≥ 8 characters); image alt keeps escapes (studio#6). No migration.

**0.18.0** (session 33, 2026-10-03): imports keep `stub_of`/`forked_from` verbatim (studio#12, **migration 0017**); `{url}` stubs cite the feed and entry, frozen at creation (#55). The build side of gate G10.

**0.17.0** (session 33, 2026-10-03): the bracket and TK grammar are inert inside code (#54, studio#4) and inside generated output (studio#5); links never nest (studio#13); preview resolves links in generated blocks (studio#14); no PUA markers reach HTML (studio#3). `src/code-ranges.ts` finds code with markdown-it's own parser. No migration.

**0.16.0** (session 32, 2026-10-03): images belong to the text they are in (`media.inline`, **migration 0016**; studio#24), attachment removal, uploads block navigation, the editor fills the window, `$` patterns spliced verbatim (studio#2), and **no built-in AI model** — operators set one (our nodes: `claude-sonnet-5-5`).

**0.15.0** (session 32, 2026-10-03): *history* on imported reading entries — the changelog read from the origin, and a word diff between public versions (decision #40, reader half). No migration.

**0.14.0** (session 32, 2026-10-03): drafted changelog notes, emitted as `changelog[].generated` when published unedited (decision #40). **Migration 0015.**

**0.13.0** (session 32, 2026-10-03): `[TK]impyrt=…[/TK]` — pasted generated text disclosed as generated (decision #37), with a *mark selection as generated* button. No migration.

**0.12.0** (session 32, 2026-10-03): stale-quote detection and one-click refresh — a *quoted snapshots* panel on the thread editor, a notice on compose listing threads whose quotes are behind, and `GET /freshness`, `GET /items/{id}/freshness`, `POST /items/{id}/refresh` (decision #33's direct check; #38's detect-always, refresh-on-decision). No migration. 757 Worker + 6 UI-state + 128 browser tests.

**0.11.1** (session 32, 2026-10-03), released and deployed: Kyle Mathews' #25 batches the public homepage's reads (≈300 D1 queries for 100 cards → 5–7) and migration **0014** adds four indexes, applied to both D1s first. Live time to first byte fell from ~4.2s to ~0.35s on venkateshrao and ~1.9s to ~0.3s on PI.

**0.11.0** (session 30, 2026-10-02): absolute URLs
in `content_html` (publish, import, bake, plus a cron repair of stored imports), thread cards that
show the thread, and image insertion at the cursor, via `/image`, paste and drop. Operators coming from
0.8.x have `docs/upgrading-to-0.11.md`. 735 Worker + 6 UI-state + 126 browser tests.

**0.10.0** (same session): Kyle
Mathews' #21 (documented `/api` + generated SDK, which was 0.9.0 and never deployed on its own)
and #22 (Studio as a React SPA). Migration **0013** (signal poll index) applied to both D1s first.
**Releases are cut by pushing a `v{version}` tag**, not by merging (session 30, Venkat):
`release.yml` builds the downloads (OpenAPI, SDK tarball, Worker archive, checksums) for that
tag.

Live on five nodes as of 2026-09-28, two of them Venkat's
(`venkateshrao.com/blyg/`, `blyg.protocol-institute.org`) and three strangers'
self-hosts. 0.8.3 was session 29's (four releases that day, 0.8.0 through 0.8.3).

0.8.0 carried the two-pane reader, `link post`, thread and reader titles, the responses
default, the timezone setting, update alerts, the `init`/`upgrade` scripts and the generic
packaging, plus the top menu, mobile pass and finished social cards. **It carried migration
0012**, applied to both databases before the deploy; a node upgrading from 0.7.0 must do the
same. 0.8.1 adds **partial transclusion** (§16.4, decision #49) — no migration, and
`PROTOCOL_VERSION` stays `"0.3"` because it implements 0.3 additively; its cross-node
exercise opened gate G7. **0.8.2** made a thread name itself in its author's own words on
all four surfaces that name one. **0.8.3** stopped the default title being the literal
`"blyg"` — derived from the deployment's own host now — and pointed `npm run upgrade` at
release tags rather than the tip of `main`, so it and the update alert agree about what
"current" means. 755 tests, `tsc` clean (with `noUnusedLocals`, on since session 28).

## Backlog — from Venkat's issue list (session 26, 2026-09-28)

> **Read entries below against 0.10.0.** Many name `studio.ts`, `importer/studio.ts`,
> `threadEditPage`, `actionScript` and other SSR-Studio code that no longer exists; the
> *semantics* in each entry still hold, but the UI half of an open item is now built in
> `src/ui/` (React) over an SDK route, adding to `src/contract/` if the route is new.

Triaged against the code, not the report. **Six items from that list turned out to touch
the wire and are not here** — they are parked in
[`../blygger-spec/docs/v0.3-plan.md`](../blygger-spec/docs/v0.3-plan.md) §8b for the Fable
round: plain `[[id]]` links, TK sources from another blyg, partial quotation, `impyrt`
(externally generated spans), `#`-heading-as-title, and the write-surface question (1.8).
**All six ruled session 27** — see §8c there and the "From the session-27 Fable round"
block below.
**Two of the five reported "bugs" are not bugs** — see §8b; the client is doing what it
was specified to do in both cases.

### Bugs

- [x] **`[[id]]` must be inert inside code spans and code blocks** — **done 0.17.0 (session 33)**, with studio#3/#5/#13/#14 (spec decision
  #54 on blygger-spec#4): §10.1 now gives the link form the same exemption the directive
  always had. studio#4 covers both forms. Fix both in one pass in the renderer and in the
  preview; a code block that quotes the grammar must publish as literal text.

- [x] ~~**Reader view doesn't roll up entries**~~ — **dropped session 30 (Venkat): a
  mistaken diagnosis**, not a bug. Nothing to build.
- [x] **Transclusion picker stops after a few items and has no search** — **done 0.7.0.**
  Neither half was what the report implied. There was never a missing query box: the query
  has always been the text you type in the editor. What existed was a *dead*
  `<input class="search">` in the palette markup, wired to nothing, which took focus and
  swallowed keystrokes and so read as a broken search field — replaced by a hint line
  naming the active bracket form. The ceiling was a silent `.slice(0, 20)`;
  `/fragments/search` now returns `total`/`offset`/`limit`, the palette states the count
  either way, and ArrowDown at the bottom of a partial list pages instead of sticking.

### Feature refinements

- [x] **Switch fragment → thread in the composer before first publish** — **done 0.7.0**,
  and the gap was in the *editor*, not the composer: the composer's toggle already worked by
  deleting the draft and recreating it, which is safe only because the text lives in the
  textarea it was typed into. Past the Full Editor door that stops being true (attachments,
  TK scopes, save history), so `PUT /api/items/:id` now accepts `kind` and changes the row
  in place. Guarded at `version === 0` in the handler *and* in `setDraftKind`'s SQL — a
  withdrawn item counts as published, because its endcap and its versions are both out
  there. A stub thread is refused (409) rather than silently losing its citation; "clear
  stub" is the way through.
- [ ] **Bulk-update stale transcluded snapshots in a stub.** **Unblocked (decision #33):**
  freshness is direct and needs nothing new on the wire — fetch `{origin}items/{id}.json`
  and compare `version` to the reference's. Build the probe and the UI against that.
  Transitive ("over the DAG") staleness is undefined and stays out.
- [ ] **Show second-degree references within a stubbed item.** Presentation is this client's
  call (§8.4 does not constrain presentation — session 20). **Check the data exists first:**
  we hold a snapshot of the target, not the target's own reference list, so this may need a
  fetch we don't currently make — in which case say so rather than half-rendering it.
- [x] **Open a reader item in a new tab** — **done 0.7.0.** Each reading entry carries
  `open ↗`, derived from `sourceTitleAndUrl` rather than a second URL-shaped guess: the
  origin's declared `page` wins (#29), `f/`·`t/` is a fallback, L0 points at the anchor its
  feed gave, own items point at our own public page, and a withdrawn own item gets no link.
  Always `target="_blank"` — the studio holds unsaved composer text.
- [x] **Offer plain linking in the reader** — **ruled #50 and built 0.7.0.** Raised as a
  possible collision with #27 by the session-28 Opus run and ruled by Fable the same
  afternoon: #27's forbidden sibling was a *response* affordance that did not declare
  itself, and #32 ruled `[[id]]` declares nothing, so this is a different act — citing
  without responding. Shipped as `copy [[id]]` in the reading entry's byline beside
  `open ↗`, **never** as a peer of `stub ↗` in the actions row, which stays the one
  affordance meaning "I am responding"; #50 makes position semantics, so the tests pin it.
  Offered only where the link would resolve at publish (`resolveTarget`'s order, #26): our
  own published items and imported non-L0 blyg items that are current or pin-retained. L0
  rows get `open ↗` and nothing else — a legacy feed has no item document to link to. The
  `[anchor](url)` half of this backlog entry is not built and is not needed: ordinary
  markdown already does it, and #50's ruling is about the construct the reader could not
  otherwise reach.
- [x] **Discard button for an unpublished new version** — **done 0.7.0, and the defect was
  worse than this entry implied.** The control existed and worked; the *thread* editor just
  never rendered it. `threadEditPage` computed `discardBtn` — both branches, with the
  comment explaining the distinction — and dropped the variable on the floor, so neither
  "discard draft" nor "discard changes" appeared on any thread. Every case in the discard
  test block opened the fragment editor, which is why a whole control could be missing from
  half the studio with the suite green. `noUnusedLocals` is now on for exactly this class.
  The session-19 `location.reload()` trap was already handled — the `discard` branch
  navigates to the index.
- [x] **Reorder the tabs** — **done 0.7.0.** reading, compose, hoppers, mentions,
  subscriptions, settings, syntax. `NAV` is the single source of order and `compose` stays
  the bare studio path wherever it sits; the order is asserted now, since it was not before
  and the reorder would have been invisible to the suite in either direction.
- [ ] ~~**Emit `cited` on every reference**~~ (decision #30, spec §16.1): serialize the existing
  `StubCite` — `source`, `author`, `excerpt` (cap ~200 chars), `url`, `retrieved`
  (REQUIRED) — as `cited` inside `stub_of`, each remote `transclusions[]` entry, and
  `forked_from`, on live and pinned documents. **Read side:** when importing a document
  that carries `cited`, use it as the frozen citation (it is more correct than a later
  lookup, not a fallback) and never as verification input; `verifyMention` reads the bare
  reference only. Never render it into `content_html`. The stale-byline finding for remote
  transclusions is the same fix.
- [x] **Render `[[id]]` as a plain internal link** — **done session 27 (0.6.0)**. Grammar
  sits beside the directive regexes in `transclusion.ts` (a negative lookbehind is all that
  separates them), resolution is literally `resolveTarget`, hrefs are absolute because
  `content_html` travels, anchor text is a short quote of the target since items are
  titleless, and previews resolve it too. Silent on the wire as ruled. Original entry:
- [ ] ~~**Render `[[id]]` as a plain internal link**~~ (decision #32, spec §16.2): inline
  anywhere in `content_md`, resolve by the `![[id]]` order (#26), render `<a href>` to the
  target's `page` (remote: origin + page), anchor text is ours to choose. Unresolvable is a
  publish error. **No** `transclusions[]` entry, **no** mention, **no** wire class — it is
  invisible on the wire by ruling, not by omission.
- [x] **`[TK]impyrt=<text>[/TK]` in the composer** — **done 0.13.0 (session 32)**: parsed in `tk.ts` with its provenance carried by the grammar (`imported`), so it never touches the positional cache; *mark selection as generated* in the editor; generate refuses it. Original entry: (decision #37, spec §5.7 rule 7): a
  studio-private TK form whose output is the pasted text verbatim, wrapped as an ordinary
  `blyg-tk-gen` span, with a `generated[]` entry carrying `sources: []` and `model`/`at`
  only if the author supplies them. No new wire member and no "external" flag. The
  composer may offer a model picker for the entry; it must not invent one.
- [ ] **Agent-contract hooks, direction only** (decision #39, roadmap-tracks 1.10/2.10):
  when 2.9's tokens land, include a **read scope** for studio-private material (drafts,
  hoppers, signals, mentions) so an agent can poll `/api` for staleness, inbound mentions
  and new imports. Poll first; no webhooks until a need is measured. The public state
  plane needs nothing — it is already the corpus.
- [x] **Generate a changelog note** — **emission done 0.14.0 (session 32)**: *draft note* in the editor (`POST /items/{id}/note-draft`, `src/change-note.ts`), editable, drafted before publish rather than at it so publish stays network-free (#26); `changelog[].generated` only when published unedited (migration 0015); the §5.2 depth rule checked mechanically (`quotesWithheld`, 6-word runs of removed text) as well as prompted. The history view below is the other half of gate G6. Original entry: (decision #40,
  roadmap-tracks 2.12, spec §5.2 + §16.6c): at publish, diff the locally held prior
  version against the new one and draft a note through the existing generation provider.
  **Pin-bounded depth is the one hard rule:** if the prior version is unpinned the note
  describes and MUST NOT quote it; between two pinned versions it may be as full as it
  likes. Editable before publish. Emit `"generated": true` on the changelog entry for such
  notes — that emission is what promotes §16.6c into §5.2.
- [x] **History view on a rolled-up item** — **done 0.15.0 (session 32)**: *history* on reading entries (blyg subscriptions), changelog read from the origin on demand (`src/imported-history.ts`), *see the change* only between public versions (adjacent pins, last pin → current), word diff in `src/word-diff.ts`. With 0.14.0's emission this is the whole build side of gate G6; G6 opens once both nodes have used it. Original entry: (#40): notes as a timeline; where two
  consecutive versions are both pinned, a local diff of the two pinned files ("see the
  change"). Needs nothing from the wire; works on any imported 0.2+ blyg with pins.
- [ ] **Discovery surfaces from references** (decision #41, roadmap-tracks 2.13). Four,
  none touching the wire, in this order of payoff:
  1. **Chain view.** Parse the stored `content_html` of an imported thread for nested
     `blockquote.blyg-transclusion` and read `data-blyg-id/version/origin` at every depth;
     render the chain with a provenance line per layer (today only the direct layer gets
     one) and a subscribe affordance per origin not in `subscriptions`. **Absent
     `data-blyg-origin` on a nested layer means the origin of the layer that baked it**,
     not ours — carry origin context down the tree. One cached manifest fetch per unknown
     origin for its title. `importer/sanitize.ts` is allowlist-by-removal and keeps
     `data-blyg-*` (verified session 27), and stored HTML is verbatim anyway.
  2. **"Responds to" walk.** From an imported item's `stub_of`, fetch
     `{origin}items/{id}.json`, show the target and follow *its* `stub_of`; bounded
     (~6), cached, each origin subscribable. Works for chains you are not in.
  3. **The conversation around you.** Verified inbound mentions ∪ your outbound
     references, grouped by origin; "responded to you, not subscribed" at the top.
  4. **Second-degree blogrolls + cited origins.** Fetch each subscription's
     `blogroll.opml` (§11) and aggregate every `origin` in imported provenance; list
     origins minus subscriptions, ordered by how many of your reads list/cite them.
     Local ordering only — never published, never shown as a count on a public page.
  **Do not** scrape another blyg's public responses list for the forward direction; it is
  presentation, and #28 keeps verified mentions off the wire by decision (spec §16.6d).
- [x] **Emit `generator_url`** and **`PROTOCOL_LEVEL` → 2** — **done session 27 (0.6.0)**,
  in one commit as this entry asked. Original entries:
- [ ] ~~**Emit `generator_url`**~~ (decision #34, spec §16.6a): one absolute URL beside
  `generator` in the manifest — `https://github.com/blygger/blygger-studio`, derived from
  `CLIENT` like `GENERATOR` is. Same commit as the level fix below; together they promote
  §16.6a into §6.1.
- [ ] ~~**`PROTOCOL_LEVEL` → `2`.**~~ Live nodes emit `"level": 1` while publishing 0.3
  constructs; 0.3's §3 defines L2 as this specification. One line. (Readers may not gate
  on it — §3.2 — so this is honesty, not compatibility.)
- [x] **Store the target version per outbound mention** — **done session 27 (0.6.1, migration
  0011)**. `mentions_out.target_version`, a null-safe change test, and withdrawal as the one
  caller allowed to force a re-send (§15.7 owes a mention precisely because nothing changed).
  This is the half the 0.3 freeze needed: §15.2 asserted the reference client did this and it
  did not. **The other half shipped in 0.12.0 (session 32)**: `src/freshness.ts` reports each
  quote of a published thread against what a republish would bake (asking `resolveTarget`
  itself, so it cannot drift from publish) and probes `{origin}items/{id}.json` for remote
  quotes; `POST /items/{id}/refresh` resyncs lagging subscriptions and republishes. Found on
  the way: "discard changes" leaves `dirty = 1` on purpose (a restore drops the positional TK
  provenance cache), so refresh gates on *holds the published words* — clean, or byte-equal
  with no `generated[]` to lose — not on `dirty`. **The same restore hazard is live for any
  republish**: restoring a version that disclosed generated text and publishing it again
  drops `generated[]`. Not fixed here; `impyrt` (#37) is the natural repair — re-wrap the
  restored spans. Original entry:
- [ ] ~~**Store the target version per outbound mention**~~ (roadmap-tracks 1.7, decision #33):
  `enqueueOutbound` resets every row to `pending` on republish because `mentions_out`
  holds no target version; spec §15.2 says unchanged references are not re-sent. Same
  missing fact as the freshness probe above — build them together.

### From the session-28 Fable round (2026-09-28) — the first 0.4 construct

- [x] **Partial transclusion** (decision #49, spec §16.4) — **built, released as 0.8.1, and
  exercised across both nodes (session 29)**. P1–P7 and P9 done; **gate G7 is open**. P8 —
  promoting §16.4 into §10.1–§10.3 and the `css-contract.md` line for `blyg-partial` — is the
  Fable session's, with the P4 call below as the rule to record.

  **The exercise (P9), all four parts passing:** PI item `0180khm1xmrgpsqqe65v51bp4w` stubs
  venkateshrao `54pwr12zqvvaj37zqx0f8vdbhk` v1, quoting one paragraph. (a) `selector` with
  `exact`/`prefix`/`suffix` on the wire beside `cited`, `blyg-partial` in the bake;
  (b) verified as `stub` on venkateshrao; (c) both classes and all three `data-blyg-*`
  intact through import; (d) a wrong passage refused at selection time. The public page
  reads *from Venkatesh Rao's Blyg ↗ · excerpt of v1*.

  **What the build settled and found:**
  - **P4 stands as written.** The bake is the selection's plain text in `<p>`s, not a carved
    sub-range of the source's inline HTML. No reason emerged to reverse it: the selection is
    defined on text, and cutting an HTML range faithfully (reopening the tags a cut crosses)
    is a second project. Emphasis in the source does not survive into the quote, which is
    the visible cost and is the right one to pay.
  - **The normalizer is the whole construct** and is one function, `selectionText` in
    `markdown.ts`, with a second entry point `normalizeSelection` for text that is already
    text (a browser selection). Its subtle rule: whitespace *within* a block collapses,
    including the raw newlines markdown-it leaves inside a `<p>`. Splitting on literal
    newlines would make a match depend on where the author pressed return.
  - **`injectProvenance` was matching the class attribute as a literal string**, so a
    partial got no provenance line — and, worse, did not advance the provenance index, so a
    thread mixing both forms mis-paired every line after the first partial. Found by opening
    the page; the suite was green. Fixed and pinned by a mixed-thread test.
  - **A partial says "excerpt of v2"** where a whole one says "snapshot of v2". §16.4 puts
    the disclosure on the second class; this is its human half, without which an excerpt and
    a whole transclusion are the same blockquote, differing only in being shorter.
  - **Select-to-quote checks at selection time**, not at publish: a passage that cannot be
    published is refused while the author is still choosing it.

  Original entry: **Implementation plan: `blygger-spec/docs/v0.4-plan.md` §7.3, tasks
  P1–P9; do this before remote sources, per §7.4.** Grammar: a `![[id]]` directive immediately followed — no blank
  line — by a markdown blockquote is a partial transclusion; the blockquote's text is the
  selection; a blank line detaches it (whole transclusion + the author's own quote stays
  writable). Publish: the selection MUST be a substring of the target snapshot's **text
  content** — `content_html` with tags stripped, whitespace collapsed within a block, block
  boundaries as line breaks; write that normalizer once and use it for publish-time check and
  any read-side re-check — else a publish error like an unresolvable directive. Wire: the
  `transclusions[]` entry gains `selector: { exact, prefix?, suffix? }` (W3C text-quote
  shape; keep prefix/suffix short, ~32 chars). `verifyMention` ignores it. Bake:
  `class="blyg-transclusion blyg-partial"` with the usual `data-blyg-*`; whether the bake
  carries inline formatting from the source HTML or plain text in `<p>`s is yours to settle
  and record. No length cap. Relation stays `transclusion`; staleness unchanged. `{url}`
  stubs get nothing — an ordinary blockquote. Studio: select text in the reading view →
  "quote" prefills the directive-plus-blockquote; the stub action prefills this form for
  long targets instead of the whole item. Record the cross-node exercise in your devlog — it
  is what lets Fable promote §16.4 into §10.
- [ ] **Read templated blygs — the manifest locates the surface** (decision #51, spec §16.6e; 0.4;
  **implementation plan: `blygger-spec/docs/v0.4-plan.md` §7.5, tasks M1–M4**). Reader side only —
  our own surface keeps the default paths and emits no template keys. Parse `feed`/`items`
  (authoritative, defaults) and the new `item`/`pin` RFC 6570 level-1 templates (`{id}`, `{n}`)
  from a fetched manifest; one expansion helper used everywhere an item or pin URL is built
  (importer, staleness check, remote `[[id]]` pages, verification). `resolve.ts` step 4: fetch
  the `rel="blyg"` href — a body that parses as a manifest *is* the manifest, else append
  `blyg.json`. Identity = manifest URL minus its last path segment, not "minus `blyg.json`".
  `page` may be absolute. One migration (subscription row gains the resolved locations,
  NULL = defaults). Gate: subscribe a live node to the first templated third-party blyg
  (the WordPress case from blygger-spec#2), transclude from it, and confirm the mention
  verifies on their side.
- [x] **Reader-side `[[id]]` affordance** — **built 0.7.0**: `copy [[id]]` in the reading
  entry's byline. See "Offer plain linking in the reader" under Feature refinements for
  what shipped and which of #50's conditions the tests pin. Opened by the Fable round in
  parallel with the build, so it was never open in practice. Original entry:
- [ ] ~~**Reader-side `[[id]]` affordance**~~ (decision #50, answering the ⚠️ FABLE flag raised
  2026-09-28 — the "distinction worth ruling on" in the feature-refinements entry above is
  the ruling): allowed, no collision with #27 — a link is not a response. Build it as the
  reader end of the `[[` picker work: an action on a reading-feed entry that **copies
  `[[id]]`** or **inserts** it into an open draft. Name it for what it does, place it beside
  copy-permalink, never as a peer of `stub ↗` in the response slot, never
  "respond"/"reply"/"answer". `stub ↗` stays the one affordance that means "I am responding".

- [ ] **Remote generation sources** (decision #44, spec §16.3; 0.4). **Implementation plan:
  `blygger-spec/docs/v0.4-plan.md` §7.2, tasks R1–R8 with acceptance checks — build from that;
  this entry is the shape.** Widen `resolveFragment`'s
  TK-source rule to `resolveTarget`'s (#26 order: local published item → imported item with a
  current or pin-retained snapshot → error; threads allowed; more than one imported match is
  an error). What is fed to the provider is the **stored local snapshot** (`content_md` as
  held), never a fetch. `ScopeProvenance.sources[]` entries take the §5.9 reference shape:
  add `origin` for remote sources (omit for own — every existing document stays valid), and
  carry `cited` the way remote `transclusions[]` entries do. Disclosure is **direct only**: a
  thread fed as a source is disclosed as that thread. **Send a Webmention** for each remote
  source on publish with relation `source`, through the existing outbound queue (target
  version stored per migration 0011); **receive** it: `verifyMention` step 4 gains a fourth
  clause — a `generated[].sources[]` entry with `origin` = ours and `id` = target →
  `source`. Relation set becomes `stub | transclusion | fork | source` everywhere it is
  enumerated (types, D1 CHECK constraints if any, the mentions view, the responses list).
  Nothing new in `content_html`. Exercise it across both live nodes — a TK scope on one
  drawing on the other's item, verified `source` on the far side, provenance intact on
  import — because that exercise is what opens the 0.4 document (#43). Bump
  `PROTOCOL_VERSION` to "0.4" in the release that ships it (#18d: emit what you implement).

### Queued for the next version (session 28, Venkat — asked for before release)

Deferred when the session wrapped, not blocked on anything.

- [x] **SEO metadata and social cards** — **most of it already existed** (`f4ac2c9`,
  session 18): `PageMeta` has driven `description`, `og:*` and `twitter:card` on the feed,
  permalink, thread, pinned and archive pages since 2026-09-13, with `og:image` as the
  item's first attached image falling back to the avatar. Session 29 closed the three real
  gaps rather than rebuilding it. **The one that mattered was the `og:title` derivation
  this entry called out in advance:** items are titleless (§5.3), so the title was a
  70-character excerpt of the rendered item — and once #46 made a leading heading the
  item's title, a titled item unfurled as "On Protocols Protocols are the thin layer…",
  the heading followed by the heading again as the first words of the body. `itemHead()`
  now reads the declared heading where there is one and takes the description from what
  *follows* it, which is the same derivation the feed page, the permalink and the studio
  reader already do. `og:title` also dropped the site suffix (`og:site_name` is the tag
  that says where). The other two: a pinned page and the archive had no `og:image` (both
  now carry the blyg's avatar — never the item's *current* attachments on a pinned page,
  whose whole promise is the bytes from then), and the archive turned out to have the same
  title-into-body defect in its **visible rows**, not just its head. No wire effect
  anywhere; a client's own `<head>` stays its own business.
- [x] **Style the nav as a proper top menu** — **done session 29.** Sections are a `<ul>`
  of real targets (padded, hover wash, the current one filled and underlined), utilities
  are their own right-hand group, and below 640px the whole bar collapses behind a
  hamburger. The collapse is gated on an `html.js` marker set in the head: a stylesheet
  that hides navigation is only safe when something can bring it back, and putting the
  marker in the head rather than beside the menu is what stops a phone painting an
  expanded menu and then snapping it shut.
- [x] **Mobile pass** — **done session 29**, and checked by opening every studio and public
  page at 390px rather than by asserting on CSS. Three real problems, all fixed: horizontal
  overflow (one pasted URL sets the page's minimum width and *every* page scrolls sideways),
  tap targets (the action rows were ~26px, the public pages' version arrows ~18px), and
  page gutters. The reading sidebar now collapses behind a control that names the source
  you are filtered to, so a collapsed sidebar still answers "what am I looking at". Opening
  the pages found one defect the suite could not: the archive listing ran a titled item's
  heading into its body, which is the fourth naming surface #46 did not reach.

### New features

- [x] **`cited` on `{url}` stubs** — **done 0.18.0 (session 33)**. Finding: a hostname-only `cited` had been emitted since 0.4 (live on three venkateshrao stubs); what was missing was the import half (studio#12, now kept verbatim) and a useful citation (feed name + entry title, frozen at creation). Original entry: (session 31, decision #55; spec §16.1a — a ruled shape,
  normative once this ships and an import retains it): when a stub targets a plain URL, emit
  the §5.9 `cited` object on `stub_of` — `retrieved` always; `source`, `author`, `excerpt`
  (≤ ~200 chars, a caption) and `url` when the page offers them. The pour-over-links
  affordance (studio#17) is the natural producer. Importer: assert `cited` survives on a
  `{url}` stub. The cross-node exercise opens gate G10.
- [ ] **`page` never changes for an item** (session 31, decision #56; spec §5.8 SHOULD): the
  client already emits a fixed `f/{id}/`·`t/{id}/`; add the assertion so slug work
  (studio#19) cannot break it, and if slugs ever ship, a renamed slug keeps a redirect.

- [ ] **Reset the owner password in settings.** **Design is fixed (decision #31), build with
  or after tokens:** a reset rotates the root secret and invalidates sessions; tokens are
  independent and survive, and the reset flow MUST list them and offer revoke-all, because
  compromise is exactly when an attacker has minted one. Auth today is one shared
  `OWNER_PASSWORD` behind a 30-day HMAC cookie. Anything beyond that shape is Fable.
- [x] **Timezone localization for displayed dates** — **done session 28.** A `timezone`
  setting, filled from a list the *browser* supplies (`Intl.supportedValuesOf`) and
  preselected to the device's zone when unset. `formatDateIn(iso, timeZone)` takes the zone
  as a **required** parameter on purpose: that turned "find every date" into a compiler
  task, and it found 28 call sites across six files. Wire unchanged and tested — feed dates
  RFC-822 in GMT, item documents ISO-8601 UTC. An invalid zone is rejected on save *and*
  falls back to UTC on render; the second half matters because a bad row is not a typo.

## Anthropic keys for the production blygs (changed 2026-10-07)

Each deployed blyg Worker has its own Anthropic key in its `AI_PROVIDER_KEY` secret (the name `models.json` maps to Anthropic): `blyg-venkateshrao` → `ANTHROPIC_KEY_BLYGS_VENKATESHRAO`, `blyg-blygger-org` → `ANTHROPIC_KEY_BLYGS_BLYGGER_ORG` (**new** — it had no AI key before, so [TK] generation is now available there), `blyg-protocol-institute` → `ANTHROPIC_KEY_BLYGS_PI` (PI account, PI workspace). All three live in `Code/.env.keys` / `protocol-institute/.env.keys`, service account `blygs`, one single-workspace key each. Coding/dev work uses `ANTHROPIC_KEY_BLYGGER`. **Not yet exercised:** run one [TK] generation in each blyg and confirm in the Console that the matching key shows usage. Set secrets with `wrangler secret put AI_PROVIDER_KEY --name <worker>` (explicit `--name`; see `Code/warnings-node.md`). Plan: `Code/anthropic-key-plan.md`.

## Session rituals

**Base:** [`Code/devops/rituals.md`](../../devops/rituals.md) — v1.0. Startup is S1–S7, wrap-up is W0–W7 (IDs reserved). Everything below is this
project's **local config**; it adds to the base and never replaces it.

**Ritual config**
- **Log:** `../blygger-spec/DEVLOG.md` (the one program log for all four repos; dated entry, non-skippable).
- **Startup extras (S5):** none
- **Verification (W2):** tests plus a real click-through on a node; for key changes see the Anthropic-keys section above.
- **Wrap-up extras (after W5):** none
- **Deploy policy:** `wrangler`-based; authenticate with `wrangler login`, always `--name` for secrets; only on request.
- **Carry-overs (S6):** none
