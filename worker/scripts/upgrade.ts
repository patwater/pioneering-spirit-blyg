// `npm run upgrade` — pull a new release of the client into your own copy.

//
// Runs under `node --experimental-strip-types` (Node 22+); no dependencies.
//
// ── The conflict surface, and why it is small ────────────────────────────────
// Everything about *your* deployment lives in exactly two files: `wrangler.jsonc`
// (committed in your copy, generic upstream) and `deploy-targets.json`
// (gitignored, so it never merges at all). Nothing under `src/` should ever need
// editing to configure an instance.
//
// That is a constraint on us, not on you. Any change upstream that makes a
// self-hoster edit `src/` to configure their instance breaks this path and
// should be a setting or an env var instead. If you find one, report it.
//
// `wrangler.jsonc` is the one file that can conflict, because you wrote yours
// and we keep editing ours. Yours always wins — see below.

// told they were current — or be told they were behind while running code newer
// than the release they were being pointed at. Worse, `CLIENT.version` on main
// between releases is the *previous* release's number, so "what am I running?"
// had no answer that meant anything.
//
// Tags are the contract now: `v*` sorted by version, newest wins. A release is
// a thing with a changelog entry stating `Migrations:`, which is exactly what
// an operator needs before deciding how careful to be.
