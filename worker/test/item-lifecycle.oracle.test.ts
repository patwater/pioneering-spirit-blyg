/**
 * Published history moves forward; restoring an old version changes the draft.
 * A pin keeps its published snapshot even after editing, withdrawal and restoration.
 * A final-content-only assertion could miss a rewound counter or rewritten history.
 *
 * Contract: docs/api.md defines restore-without-publish and permanent pins. The
 * established restore-version acceptance tests define the forward-only counter.
 * These are local content laws, not HTTP or OAuth requirements.
 * Model: working copy content, status, dirty flag, authored kind and immutable versions.
 * Withdrawal appends an empty withdrawn snapshot; restore copies text without
 * removing any version. Pinning changes visibility of one existing snapshot.
 * History grammar: fragment/thread, plain nonempty text and at most ten generated
 * choices. Legal operations depend on model state; restore/pin target nonempty
 * published snapshots. A fixed history forces repeated pin and restore-after-withdraw.
 * Driver: named generated SDK operations through SELF to the real Worker and D1.
 * Refinement: after creation and every awaited action, compare owner working state,
 * ordered history, public current projection, pin visibility and pinned wire bytes.
 * Limits: no TK, transclusions, forks, deletion, concurrent publication or arbitrary
 * Markdown rendering. Retaining first pin bytes is a metamorphic check, not an
 * independent expected encoding. docs/testing.md records this bounded domain.
