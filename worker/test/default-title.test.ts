// The default a blyg publishes when nobody has set a title.
//
// It used to be the literal string "blyg". That leaked: by session 29 two
// independent live nodes were publishing `"title": "blyg"` in their manifests
// because neither operator had opened Settings, and blygger.com listed both
// under that name — which then briefly got a real submission held as a
// suspected impersonation. Venkat's ruling on that:
//
//   "blyg as name is people setting lazy defaults. We shouldn't use that as the
//    discriminator. Blyg name collisions are okay if different domains. There
//    can be 2 'Joe's blyg' sites. What's actually needed there is a new feature
//    in the reference client that sets more unique defaults."
//
// So the collision is manufactured here and fixed here. A directory must not
// have to tell deployments apart by a name none of their operators chose.
