// Every surface that *names* a thread names it in the author's own words.
//
// Reported by Venkat: "the main public display page still doesn't display
// thread cards properly." The cause was general, and the feed card was only
// where it was visible. A thread's `content_html` carries other people's
// writing baked in as `blockquote.blyg-transclusion` (§10). That is right on
// the thread's own page, where a quote is displayed as a quote with provenance
// under it. It is wrong in every derived one-liner, because flattening the HTML
// to text drops exactly the structure that made the attribution legible.
//
// Measured on the live node before the fix: of 19 published threads, 5 *opened*
// with a transclusion — the shape the stub action prefills — so their browser
// tab, search heading, social card, RSS headline and feed-page excerpt were all
// someone else's sentence presented as the author's.
//
// The studio's index rows had always been correct. These tests exist so the
// public ones cannot drift back.
//
// Session 30 changed the *feed card* half (Venkat): the card now renders the
// top of the thread's own page — real HTML, quotes as blockquotes with their
// provenance line — instead of a plain-text teaser. Quoted words therefore DO
// appear on the card again, but only where the page shows them: inside the
// transclusion blockquote, never in the author's prose around it. The one-line
// surfaces (title, og:title, RSS headline, archive row) are unchanged.
